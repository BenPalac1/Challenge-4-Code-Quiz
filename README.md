# Challenge-4-Code-Quiz
Module 4 Challenge

## Description:
    This repo contains my solution for the Module 4 Challenge of the Full Stack Web Development course.

    This Coding Quiz application allows a user to take a multiple choice quiz and save their highscores to localStorage.
      When users click the start button a 60 second timer coutns down and the first question is shown.  For every question answered 
      incorrectly, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer.  The quiz is over when the user answers all of the questions in the given 
      time or the timer reaches 0.  At the end of the quiz, users can submit their highscore and initials.

## User Story:
  AS A coding boot camp student
  
  I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
  
  SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria:
  GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
  
  WHEN I click the start button

  THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

  WHEN I answer a question

  THEN I am presented with another question

  WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

  THEN time is subtracted from the clock

  WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

  THEN the game is over

  WHEN the game is over

  THEN I can save my initials and score

## Instructions:
    Open the index.html in a browser.  Click the Start button to begin the quiz.  Answer all questions by clicking on one of the multiple choices for each.
    At the end of the quiz enter your initials and click Save Score.  To try again just refresh the page. Rinse and Repeat as needed.
